# keyboard-name-code
Super simple keyboard name and code display with keydown event listener

Heavily Inspired by Wes Bos's similar tool [keycode.info](http://keycode.info/) but I wanted to make this even simpiler in that this does not have any mapping. This only pulls from the keystroke data already on the DOM.

[DEMO](http://keycode.erbwebdev.com/)
